## Description

This repository contains a team of four people's effort for [**AIR SELANGOR DATA & DIGITAL HACKATHON 2024â€‹**](https://digital.airselangor.com/hackathon/)'s problem statement number 3. 

## Problem Statement

The present water meter management faces challenges such as imprecise forecasting of new meter demand, manual tracking causing unrecorded or missing meters, and lack of integration with meter testing lab results, resulting in suboptimal inventory levels. There's a need for an advanced system employing intelligent algorithms to achieve higher efficiency and accuracy.
